### Report: Comprehensive Plan for LLM Development of Roguelike Dungeon Crawler in Godot

This report provides a detailed, guided, step-by-step project prompt and architectural document for a large language model (LLM) to develop a roguelike dungeon crawler game in Godot, using an IDE like Cursor in an agentic setting. The goal is to reach a playable MVP, with attention to detail and a macro plan, focusing on mechanics without assets. The plan is informed by various resources and tutorials, ensuring a structured approach to implementation, and is designed for immediate execution as of 03:23 PM PDT on Tuesday, March 25, 2025.

#### Project Overview and Context
Roguelike dungeon crawlers are characterized by procedurally generated levels, permadeath, and real-time exploration, often involving fighting monsters and collecting loot. Given the user's request for no assets, the game will use Godot's built-in shapes and colors for visual representation, focusing on 2D mechanics. The LLM must leverage Godot's scene-based architecture and GDScript to build the game autonomously, with Cursor providing code suggestions and error checking to enhance development.

The game concept involves a player exploring a procedurally generated dungeon, fighting monsters, and collecting items, with permadeath meaning the game ends if the player dies, requiring a restart. Key components include dungeon generation, player mechanics, monster AI, items, UI, and game flow, all implemented without custom assets.

#### Macro Plan for Playable MVP
The macro plan involves setting up the project, creating essential scenes, and implementing core mechanics in a phased approach:

1. **Project Setup**: Create a new Godot project and set up the main scenes: MainMenu, Game, and GameOver.
2. **MainMenu Implementation**: Add buttons for starting a new game and exiting, with scene transition logic.
3. **Game Scene Development**: Focus on dungeon generation, player and monster mechanics, item interactions, UI, and game flow, ensuring all components integrate seamlessly.
4. **GameOver Scene**: Implement a simple "Game Over" screen with an option to restart, completing the basic game loop.
5. **Testing and Iteration**: Ensure the MVP is playable, with the player able to explore, fight, and die, restarting as needed.

This plan ensures a structured progression, with each phase building on the previous, aiming for a functional game within the LLM's capabilities.

#### Detailed Component Breakdown

##### Project Setup
- Create a new Godot project named "RoguelikeDungeonCrawler".
- Create three scenes:
  - `MainMenu.tscn`
  - `Game.tscn`
  - `GameOver.tscn`
- Set `MainMenu.tscn` as the main scene in Project Settings.

##### MainMenu Implementation
- In `MainMenu.tscn`, add a `CenterContainer` with a `VBoxContainer`.
- Inside `VBoxContainer`, add two `Button` nodes: "New Game" and "Exit".
- Connect "New Game" button's `pressed` signal to `get_tree().change_scene_to_file("res://Game.tscn")`.
- Connect "Exit" button's `pressed` signal to `get_tree().quit()`.

##### Game Scene Development

###### Dungeon Generation
The dungeon is generated using Binary Space Partitioning (BSP), a recursive algorithm that splits space into rooms and connects them with corridors, as detailed in [Jono Shields' BSP Dungeon Tutorial](https://jonoshields.com/post/bsp-dungeon). This ensures varied layouts each game.

- **Implementation Steps**:
  - Define a grid size, e.g., 20x20 cells, each 16x16 pixels for visibility.
  - Create a `Branch` class to represent BSP tree nodes, with position and size attributes.
  - Implement a `split` function to recursively divide the space, controlling depth for room count (e.g., depth 5 for 32 rooms).
  - Connect rooms with corridors by finding centers and creating paths, ensuring connectivity.
  - Use a `TileMap` node to display the dungeon, with walls as black squares and floors as gray squares, mapping grid cells to TileMap coordinates.
- **Placement Logic**:
  - After generation, place the player, monsters, and items in random floor cells within rooms, avoiding overlaps.

This ensures a procedurally generated dungeon, a core roguelike feature, without needing custom assets.

###### Player Mechanics
The player is represented by a `KinematicBody2D` node, using a colored square for visuals, with scripts handling movement, attacking, and item interactions, informed by Godot tutorials like [Davide Pesce's Monster AI Tutorial](https://www.davidepesce.com/2019/11/12/godot-tutorial-10-monsters-and-artificial-intelligence/).

- **Attributes**:
  - Health: 10, Attack Power: 2, with variables for tracking.
  - Inventory managed implicitly, with items applied on pickup.
- **Mechanics**:
  - Movement: Use input actions (arrow keys or WASD) to move in four directions, using `move_and_collide` for collision detection with walls and monsters, with grid-based movement in steps of 16 pixels.
  - Attacking: Press a key (e.g., space) to check adjacent cells for monsters, damaging them based on attack power.
  - Item Pickup: On collision with item nodes, apply effects (e.g., health potion adds 5 health) and remove the item, using `Area2D` for detection.
- **Signals**:
  - Emit signals for health and attack power changes, used by UI for updates.

This implementation ensures responsive player mechanics, with grid-based movement for simplicity in checking adjacent cells.

###### Monster AI
Monsters are also `KinematicBody2D` nodes, with colored shapes for visuals, implementing simple AI for movement and combat, as described in [Robbert.rocks' Simple AI Tutorial](https://robbert.rocks/implementing-a-simple-ai-for-games-in-godot) and [Godot Engine Documentation on Enemies](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/first_2d_game/04.creating_the_enemy.html).

- **Attributes**:
  - Types: Slime (health 2, attack 1), Goblin (health 5, attack 2), Orc (health 10, attack 3), with variables for tracking.
  - Multiple instances placed during dungeon generation.
- **AI Implementation**:
  - Use a finite state machine (FSM) for behaviors, with states like IDLE, CHASING, and ATTACKING.
  - In CHASING, move towards the player if within range (e.g., 5 cells), using grid-based pathfinding (BFS or A*) to avoid walls.
  - In ATTACKING, damage the player if adjacent, with logic in `_physics_process`.
- **Movement**:
  - Convert continuous positions to grid coordinates for pathfinding, moving step by step towards the player, checking walkable cells.

An interesting aspect is the implementation of grid-based pathfinding, adding depth to AI without assets, which is more advanced than expected for pure mechanics.

###### Items
Items are nodes (e.g., `Area2D`) with scripts defining effects, placed randomly in rooms during generation.

- **Types and Effects**:
  - HealthPotion: Increases player health by 5.
  - Sword: Increases attack power by 1.
  - Armor: Increases defense by 1 (reduces damage taken).
- **Pickup Logic**:
  - On collision with the player, apply the effect and `queue_free()` to remove the node, ensuring immediate application without inventory management for simplicity.

This aligns with the no-assets focus, using Godot's collision system for interactions.

###### User Interface (UI)
The UI is minimal, showing player stats, implemented with a `Panel` node and `Labels`, informed by Godot's UI documentation.

- **Setup**:
  - Create a `Panel` at the top or bottom, with `Labels` for "Health: " + str(player.health) and "Attack: " + str(player.attack).
  - Use `HBoxContainer` or `VBoxContainer` for layout, ensuring readability.
- **Updates**:
  - Connect to player's signals for health and attack power changes, updating labels in real-time using `_on_player_health_changed` and similar functions.

This keeps the interface functional, ensuring player feedback.

###### Game Flow and Management
The `GameManager` script handles scene transitions and game logic, ensuring permadeath and restart functionality.

- **Death Check**:
  - In the main game loop, check if player health â‰¤ 0, then use `get_tree().change_scene_to_file("res://GameOver.tscn")` to load the GameOver scene.
- **Scene Transitions**:
  - From MainMenu, load Game scene on "New Game" button press.
  - From GameOver, provide a button to load MainMenu or restart, using similar scene change functions.

This ensures a complete game loop, with permadeath as a core roguelike feature.

#### Feasibility and Considerations
Given the LLM's capabilities, as evidenced by its ability to handle complex logic in tutorials like [SelinaDev's Godot Roguelike Tutorial](https://selinadev.github.io/05-rogueliketutorial-01/), it can likely implement this plan. The IDE Cursor enhances this by providing code suggestions and error checking, supporting agentic development. However, the complexity lies in coordinating Godot's node system and ensuring all scripts integrate, which requires a detailed plan as provided.

An interesting aspect is the potential for the LLM to implement grid-based pathfinding for monsters, adding depth to AI without assets, which is more advanced than typical simple movement. This aligns with resources like [Stone Sigil Studios' BSP Roguelike C# Tutorial](https://stonesigil.com/blog/bsp-roguelike-csharp/), showing advanced procedural generation possibilities.

#### Conclusion
This plan provides a roadmap for the LLM to build a roguelike dungeon crawler in Godot, achieving a playable MVP with no human intervention, focusing on mechanics and leveraging Godot's capabilities. The detailed steps ensure all components are covered, from dungeon generation to game flow, making it feasible within the agent's setting in Cursor.
